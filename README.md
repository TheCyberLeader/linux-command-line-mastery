# least-privilege-in-action
🐧 Practical use of Linux commands to manage permissions and enforce least privilege principles.

**Project Title**: *Implementing and Enforcing Least Privilege in Linux Environments*

**Project Introduction**: Using a Linux virtual machine, I practiced applying file permissions, group policies, and user roles to minimize privilege across the system.

**Modeling and Evaluation**: Command-line operations (chmod, chown, umask, groups) were used to model access control. Success was evaluated based on principle of least privilege and audit compliance.

**Conclusion**: Proper permissions were enforced without affecting functionality. Future improvements include integrating auditd for enhanced visibility into file access.
